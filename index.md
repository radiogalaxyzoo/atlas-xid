### Abstract
Radio source host galaxy cross-identification is the problem of determining the host galaxies of radio sources detected in wide-area radio surveys. We propose a method for reducing the cross identification task to the standard machine learning task of binary classification. We apply our methods to the $1.4$~GHz Australian Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) observations of the \emph{Chandra} Deep Field South (CDFS) and the ESO Large Area ISO Survey South 1 (ELAIS-S1) fields, cross-identifying them with the \emph{Spitzer} Wide-area Infrared Extragalactic survey (SWIRE). We compare two sets of training data: expert cross-identifications of CDFS from the initial ATLAS data release and crowdsourced cross-identifications of CDFS from Radio Galaxy Zoo. Our results show that the cross-identification accuracy of the predictor trained on Radio Galaxy Zoo cross-identifications is comparable to the predictor trained on expert cross-identifications, demonstrating the value of crowdsourced training data.
